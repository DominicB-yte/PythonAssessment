 Encryption software

#### Introduction:
This software is designed to be used as a way for you to both encrypt and decrypt text files. There are two types of
encryption that are used for this program, being Caesar Cipher and Polyalphabetic Subsittution. Caesar Chipher was 
first recorded being used by Julius Caesar and works by substituting one letter with another letter by a fixed amount.
An example would be shifting by 3 which would mean A is substituted with D.

Next, Polyaphabetic Substitution (more specifically Vigen√®re cipher in the case of this program) was first invented by
a man named Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553. The Substitution method is similar to the one used by the Caesar cipher,
with the difference being that it instead uses a keyword to determine what a given letter is substituted with.

#### Feature List:
- The user can choose if they want to either encrypt or decrypt a file.
- The user is given a choice of what type of cipher they would like to use, choosing between Caesar Cipher and 
Polyalphabetic Substitution
- The user is then prompted to give either a number or a keyword depending on what cipher they decided on using.
- The file is then either encrypted or decrypted and written as a new text file.

#### Getting Started:
For encrypting a file, you first need to
- press 1 to select "Encrypt"
- Choose between Caesar or Polyalphabetic by pressing 1 or 2 respectively
- enter the name of your file (e.g. Report)
- For caesar, type in any number (e.g. 3)
- For polyalphabetic, type in any combination of characters (e.g. Keyword)

For decrypting a file, you need to
- press 2 to select "Decrypt"
- From here, the steps are the same as they are for encrypting a file.
